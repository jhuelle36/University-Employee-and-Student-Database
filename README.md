# University Employee and Student Database
Implemented a menu-based database system in Java for storing staff members, faculty, and students. Allows users to add, delete, display, and lookup people by using the menu choices. All people are classified by a unique ID number given to them. After ending the program a text file will be created displaying all of the people's information.
